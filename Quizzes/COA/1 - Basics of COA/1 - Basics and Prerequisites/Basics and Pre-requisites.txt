MSQ: Identify the correct buses used in CPU.
A) Memory Bus
B) Data Bus 
C) Address Bus
D) Control Bus
Answer: B,C,D

NAT: Address Bus is Bidirectional. (True/False)
Answer: False
Explanation: Since address bus is used to send signals from CPU to Memory hence it only needs to be unidirectional.

NAT: Control Bus is Fully Bidirectional. (True/False)
Answer: False
Explanation: False since the individual lines within the bus are unidirectional.

MCQ: Select the nature of Data Bus.
A) Fully Bidirectional
B) from CPU to Memory
C) from Memory to CPU
D) Unidirectional 
Answer: A
Explanation: Data Bus connects both simultaneously and each individual line can send data both ways however only one can use this bus to send at a time.

MCQ: What is the value stored by Program Counter?
A) Memory Address of Current Instruction
B) Memory Address of Next Instruction
C) Current Instruction
D) Next Instruction
Answer: B

MSQ: What is/are the value stored by Accumulator
A) Result of ALU Operation
B) Memory Address of Next Instruction
C) Current Instruction
D) ALU Operand
Answer: A,D
Explanation: Accumulator usually stores the result of the ALU operation however in AC-based architecture, it can also store one of the operands for the ALU operation.

MCQ: What is the value stored by Instruction Register?
A) Memory Address of Current Instruction
B) Memory Address of Next Instruction
C) Current Instruction
D) Next Instruction
Answer: C

MCQ: What is the value stored in the Stack Pointer?
A) Memory Address of bottom of Stack of current process
B) Memory Address of starting of Stack of current process
C) Memory Address of top of Stack of current process
D) Memory Address of ending of Stack of current process
Answer: C

MSQ: What are some of the flags of Program Status Word ?
A) Branch Flag
B) Carry Flag
C) Sign Flag
D) Zero Flag
Answer: B,C,D

MSQ: What is the Address register used for ?
A) Used to send Memory Address to CPU
B) Used to send Memory Address to Memory
C) Used by Memory to receive Memory Address 
D) Used by CPU to receive Memory Address 
Answer: B
Explanation: Since the Address bus is unidirectional from CPU to Memory hence we can only send from CPU to memory and memory can only receive but it doesn't uses it directly.

MSQ: What is the Data register used for ?
A) Used to send Data to CPU
B) Used to send Data to Memory
C) Used by Memory to receive Data
D) Used by CPU to receive Data 
Answer: B,D
Explanation: Since Data bus is bidirectional so we can use it send and receive data in both ways however CPU is the one that uses it.
