Answer: A

NAT: If 16K cells in memory, then address is of _____ bits. 
Answer: 14
Explanation: Total Memory Locations = 16K = 2^14
Bits in Address = log2(No. of Memory Locations) = log2(2^14)= 14

NAT: If 2G cells in memory, then address is of _____ bits. 
Answer: 31
Explanation: Total Memory Locations = 2G = 2^31
Bits in Address = log2(No. of Memory Locations) = log2(2^31) = 31

NAT: If address is 27 bits, then memory has _____ M cells ? 
Answer: 128
Explanation: No. of memory location = 2 ^ (bits in address)
No. of Memory Locations/Cells = 2^27 = 128M

MCQ: Storage of a byte addressable memory cell ? 
A) 1 Word
B) 2 Byte
C) 1 Byte
D) 2 Word
Answer: C

MCQ: Storage of a word addressable memory cell ? 
A) 1 Word
B) 2 Byte
C) 1 Byte
D) 2 Word
Answer: A

MSQ: Total memory capacity is given by ? 
A) Bits in Address * capacity of each cell
B) No. of cells * capacity of each cell
C) Total address locations * capacity of each cell
D) No. of cells * 1 byte
Answer: B,C
Explanation: There will be as many address as there are cells in memory. 

NAT: Memory capacity = 8MB for byte addressable memory, how many bits in address ? 
Answer: 23
Explanation: 8MB = 2^23
No. of bits in address = log2(2^23) = 23

NAT: Memory capacity 16GB for word addressable memory (1 word = 8 bytes), how many bits in address ?
Answer: 31
Explanation: Total Capacity = No. of cells * capacity of each cell
So, No. of cells = Total Capacity / capacity of each cell
No. of cells = 2^34 / 2^3
No. of cells = 2^31
Bits in address = log2(No. of cells) = log2(2^31) => 31

NAT: Given word addressable memory with word size 64 bits, address is 18 bits long, then memory size is _____ MB ?
Answer: 2
Explanation: 64bits = 8Bytes
Total Memory Cells = 2^18
Total Memory capcity = 2^18 * 2^3 = 2^21 => 2MB

NAT: Which memory addressing results in least wastage of space Byte Addressable(1) or Word Addressable (2) ?
Answer: 1
Explanation: If we store say any data less than the word in Word Addressable memory, it will still occupy a while cell, i.e. a word worth of space hence wasting space.

MCQ: How to find address of nth instruction ? 
A) Current Address + (n - 1) * size of each instruction
B) Next Address + n * size of each instruction
C) Base Address + (n - 1) * size of each instruction
D) Base Address + n * size of each instruction
Answer: C

MCQ: How to find the Program Counter value for nth instuction ? 
A) Current Address + (n - 1) * size of each instruction
B) Next Address + n * size of each instruction
C) Base Address + (n - 1) * size of each instruction
D) Base Address + n * size of each instruction
Answer: D
Explanation: Since PC contains the address of the next instruction. So if we get the current instruction address using (BA + (n-1) * Instn Size) then we can get the next instn using (BA + (n) * Instn Size)

MSQ: Systems based on byte ordering ?
A) Little Endian
B) Big Endian
C) Large Endian
D) Small Endian
Answer: A,B
Explanation: Little-Endian (MSB at lowest position), Big-Endian (MSB at highest position)
Q Max and min address length for a 32-bit architecture CPU ? (2^32 - 1)(all 32 1s)(max) 0(all 32 0s)(min)
Q Read and write signal sent from ?
(Arrange the statements to correctly access memory read or write)
Qwhat are these signals ? Control signals
