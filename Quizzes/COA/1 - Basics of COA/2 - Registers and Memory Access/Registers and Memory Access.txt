Read and write signal sent from ?
(Arrange the statements to correctly access memory read or write)

ready and wait signal sent from ?

what are these signals ? Control signals

if 16K cells in memory, how many bits in address ? 2^14

if 2G cells in memory, how many bits in address ? 2^31

if address is 27 bits, then how many cells ? 128M

Storage of a byte addressable memory cell ? 1 Byte

Storage of a word addressable memory cell ? 1 Byte

Total memory capacity = ? No. of cells * capacity of each cell

Memory capacity = 8MB for byte addressable memory, no. of address bits ? 23

Memory capacity 16GB for word addressable memory (1 word = 8 bytes), then address bite ? 31

Given word addressable memory with word size 64 bits, address is 18 bits long, then memory size ? 2MB

Which memory addressing results in least wastage of space BA or WA ? Byte Addressable

how to find address of nth instruction ? Base Address + (n - 1) * size of each instruction

How to find the PC value for nth instuction ? Base Address + n * size of each instruction (since we are basically looking one ahead)

Systems based on byte ordering ? Little-Endian (MSB at lowest position), Big-Endian (MSB at highest position)

Max and min address length for a 32-bit architecture CPU ? (2^32 - 1)(all 32 1s)(max) 0(all 32 0s)(min)
