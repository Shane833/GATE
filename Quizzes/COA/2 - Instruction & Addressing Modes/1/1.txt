NAT: Given a CPU supports 8 distinct instruction, the opcode is ______ bit long?
Answer: 3
Explanation: If the no. of distinct operations supported by CPU = n
then opcode length = ceil(log2[n]) bits
So, log2(8) = 3

MCQ: If the no. of distinct operations/instructions supported by CPU is n, then the opcode is ______ bit long?
A) log2(n)
B) floor(log2(n))
C) ceil(log2(n))
D) 2^n
Answer: C
Explanation: We take the ceil as the addresses have to be in powers of 2
