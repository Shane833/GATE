NAT: Consider Variable length instructions Type A, Type B, Type C, and there are 3 instructions of type A, 5 instructions of Type B and 14 instructions of Type C then opcode length is ________ bits.
Answer: 5
Explanation: 
Total distinct instructions = 3 + 5 + 14 = 22
Length of opcode = ceil[Log2(no. of distinct instructions)]
Length of opcode = ceil[Log2(22)]
Length of opcode = 5
