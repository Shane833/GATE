D) Null Miss
Answer: A

MCQ: Which of the following is a type of Cache Miss?
A) Size Miss
B) Storage Miss
C) Hot Miss
D) Conflict Miss
Answer: D

A) When the Cache blocks is accessed first time
B) When the Cache blocks is accessed again / repeat access
C) When the Cache is Empty
D) When the Cache blocks already contains another memory block
Answer: A,C
Explanantion: Cold Miss occurs when the memory block is accessed for the first time and if cache is every empty, then it means it loading data for the first time meaning it is still a cold miss

MSQ: When does Capactiy Miss Occur?
A) When the Cache blocks is accessed first time
B) When the Cache blocks is accessed again / repeat access
C) When the Cache is Empty
D) When the Cache if Full
Answer: B,D

A) When the Cache block already contains another memory block
B) When the Cache blocks is accessed again / repeat access
C) When the Cache is Empty
D) When the Cache set is Full
Answer: A,B,D

A) Increase Cache Size
B) Increase Associtivity
C) Increase Block Size
D) Can't do anything
Answer: C
Explanantion: When we increase the block size more data/addresses can be packed into mem blocks leading to less no. of unique blocks in memory hence less cold misses

MCQ: How to reduce Capacity Misses?
A) Increase Cache Size
B) Increase Associtivity
C) Increase Block Size
D) Can't do anything
Answer: A
Explanantion: If the cache can hold more blocks there will be more places where each mem block gets mapped and can hold more blocks at a time hence reducing the no. of Capacity Misses.

MCQ: How to reduce Conflict Misses?
A) Increase Cache Size
B) Increase Associtivity
C) Increase Block Size
D) Can't do anything
Answer: B
Explanantion: By Increasing Associativity each set can hold more no. of blocks hence reducing the conflict.

NAT: Does conflict misses occur in Fully Associative Cache? (Yes/No)
Answer: No
Explanantion: Since each block gets mapped to one big set no conflict miss can occur, if the misses occur they will be either of the type cold or capacity.
