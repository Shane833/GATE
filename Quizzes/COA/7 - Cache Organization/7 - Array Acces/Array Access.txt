MCQ: Total no. of misses on the first iteration of Array = ________.
A) Total no. of blocks in cache
B) Total no. of memory blocks
C) Total no. of memory blocks occupied by Array
D) Total no. of cache blocks occupied by Array
Answer: C
Explanation: Since each memory block containing the array elements will be accessed for the first time hence misses will be equal to the no. of memory blocks occupied by the array.

MCQ: How to find the no. of extra blocks in Array Access?
A) No. of array occupied mem blocks
B) No. of blocks occupied by array in cache
C) Total no. of cache blocks
D) No. of mem blocks occupied by array - no. of total cache blocks
Answer: D
Explanation: Well they are extra bcz they can't fit in the cache at a time.

MCQ: Total no. of misses on the repeated iteration of Array = _________.
A) Total no. of blocks in cache + 2
B) Total no. of extra blocks for array * 2
C) Total no. of extra blocks
D) Total no. of cache blocks occupied by Array
Answer: B
Explanation: First the extra blocks will be replaced by the starting blocks and then again these starting blocks will be replaced by extra blocks i.e. 2 time these extra blocks are getting replaced and rest of the array will be present in the cache.

MCQ: Where the does extra blocks gets mapped to ?
A) At the starting block of the cache
B) At the ending block of the cache
C) At the block where first array mem blocks get mapped
D) From the Middle of the cache blocks
Answer: C
Explanation: Since the extra blocks will replace the starting blocks of the array, hence they will also map to the cache blocks where the starting blocks were mapped.

MCQ: No. of Memory blocks occupied by Array = ________.
A) ceil(Memory Size occupied by Array / Block Size)
B) Array Size / Block Size
C) Memory Size / Array Size
D) ceil(Block Size / Memory Size occupied by Array)
Answer: A

MCQ: Given Cache Size = 32B, Block Size = 2B, Array A[20] each element is 2B then find the total no. of misses on 3 iterations of Array?
A) 32
B) 24
C) 36
D) 40
Answer: C
Explanation: No. of Cache Blocks = 32/2 => 16 Blocks
Total memory for Array = 20 * 2 => 40B
Total Memory blocks occupied by array = 40/2 => 20 Blocks
Extra Blocks = 20 - 16 => 4 Blocks
First Iteration Misses = No. of Blocks occupied by Array => 20
Repeat Iteration Misses = 2 * No. of Extra Blocks = 2 * 4 => 8 
Total Misses for 3 Iterations : 20 + 8 + 8 => 36

MCQ: What are the total no. of Memory Access done when iterating through an Array once?
A) No. of mem blocks occupied by Array
B) No. of Cache Blocks
C) No. of extra blocks 
D) No. of elements in Array
Answer: D
Explanation: CPU will generate as many addresses as there are element in the array hene that will be the no. of memory accesses.
