MCQ: Threads perform the best on _____________ OS.
A) UniProgramming
B) MultiProgramming
C) MultiTasking
D) MultiProcessing
Answer: D
Explanation: Since threads can utilize multiple processors and execute tasks quickly.

MSQ: Types of threads that exist are:
A) Kernel Level Threads
B) Network Level Threads
C) User Level Threads
D) I/O Level Threads
Answer: A,C

MCQ: If a user level thread is blocked then OS will _____________.
A) Do Nothing
B) Blocks the thread only
C) Blocks the entire process
D) Ignore the thread
Answer: C
Explanation: Since OS is not responsible for creating user-level threads therefore it has no idea that they exist and if even one of the threads is blocked (for I/O), then OS will only see that process is requesting I/O and hence will block the entire process.

MCQ: If a kernel level thread is blocked then OS will _____________.
A) Do Nothing
B) Blocks the thread only
C) Blocks the entire process
D) Ignore the thread
Answer: B
Explanation: Since OS is responsible for creating kernel-level threads therefore it can block an individual thread.

MCQ: Who is responsible for creating threads?
A) OS
B) Kernel
C) Process
D) child processes
Answer: C
Explanation: A process is always responsible for creating its threads while they can be managed by OS threading libraries or the process itself, but eventually process is responsible for creating threads initially.

MSQ: User Level threads are ___________.
A) Specific to OS
B) Generic
C) Faster to create and manage
D) Slower to create and manage
Answer: B,C

MSQ: Kernel Level threads are ___________.
A) Specific to OS
B) Generic
C) Faster to create and manage
D) Slower to create and manage
Answer: A,D

MCQ: What is System Call?
A) Way to request service from kernel
B) Way to overwrite service from kernel
C) Way to take control of kernel
D) Way to exploit kernel
Answer: A

MCQ: malloc() is a ______ call.
A) sys
B) process
C) library function
D) memory
Answer: C
Explanation: malloc() is a library function which manages the heap memory within the memory segment of the process along with free(), it may internally use other syscall to increase the size of its memory space but it is itself a library function.

MCQ: fork() is a ______ call.
A) sys
B) process
C) library function
D) memory
Answer: A
Explanation: fork() is a syscall() which is used by the process to create child processes which is a WHOLE new process.

MCQ: What does fork() return?
A) NULL
B) Nothing
C) Integral Value
D) Floating Point Value
Answer: C
Explanation: fork() returns integral values: +ve : for successful creating of child process and return the Pid (which is the +ve value) of the child process created. 0 : This is the returned to the child process at same point in the src code where the fork() was called. -ve : This means that fork() was unsuccessful in creating child process.

MCQ: For n consecutive fork() calls how many total processes are present?
A) 2^n
B) n
C) (2^n) - 1
D) 2^n-1
Answer: A
Explanation: 1 original/parent + (2^n) - 1 child processes = 2^n

MCQ: For n consecutive fork() calls how many child processes are created?
A) 2^n
B) n
C) (2^n) - 1
D) 2^n-1
Answer: C
Explanation: 1 original/parent + (2^n) - 1 child processes = 2^n

MCQ: Where does the process execution continue in child process?
A) From the start
B) Can't say
C) Right after the fork() call in parent src
D) Right before the fork() call in parent src
Answer: C

MSQ: Which of the following are syscalls?
A) print()
B) fork()
C) calculate()
D) wait()
Answer: B,D
Explanation: Syscalls are programming interfaces to the operating system's services. fork() creates a new process, and wait() suspends the execution of the calling process until one of its children processes terminates.

MCQ: What is the function of a wait syscall?
A) Create a new child process.
B) Terminate the current process.
C) Suspend the execution of the calling process until one of its child processes terminates.
D) Allocate memory to the process.
Answer: C
Explanation: The "wait" syscall is used for process synchronization. The parent process waits for the child process to finish its execution.

MSQ: CPU-level threads are also known as:
A) User-level threads
B) Kernel-level threads
C) Lightweight processes
D) Heavyweight processes
Answer: B,D
Explanation: CPU-level threads, also known as kernel-level threads, are managed by the operating system kernel. They are also referred to as heavyweight processes because they have their own independent execution context and resources.

MCQ: What does fork() return in the calling process?
A) Zero
B) A negative value
C) The process ID of the child process
D) An error code
Answer: C
Explanation: In the calling process (the parent), fork() returns the process ID (PID) of the newly created child process. This allows the parent to keep track of and manage its child processes.

MCQ: What does fork() return in the child process?
A) Zero
B) A negative value
C) The process ID of the child process
D) An error code
Answer: A
Explanation: In the child process, fork() returns zero. This allows the child process to distinguish itself from the parent and execute different code if needed.
